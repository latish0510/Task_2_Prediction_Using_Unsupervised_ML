# Prediction_Using_Unsupervised_ML

##  Project done during the Data Science & Business Analytics Internship at The Sparks Foundation.

## Task 2 - From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.  

* Libraries Used: Scikit Learn, Pandas, Numpy
* Dataset: Iris Dataset
* ALGORITHM USED - K-Means

K-means is a centroid-based algorithm, or a distance-based algorithm, where we calculate the distances to assign a point to a cluster. In K-Means, each cluster is associated with a centroid.
